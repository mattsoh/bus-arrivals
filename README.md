# bus-arrivals
Displays bus arrival times in Singapore using LTA's DataMall API.

Just enter 5-digit bus stop code.

Note that this service is only available when there are actually buses operating in Singapore (obviously), so make sure you are running this program during roughly 7:00am - 12:00 am (Singapore Standard Time, GMT+8)
